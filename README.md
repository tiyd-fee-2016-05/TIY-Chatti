# TIY-Chatti

**Monday progress**:

* MB took the lead in creating the html and scss for the assignment.

*   Erik took the lead in starting the JavaScript file. We did some pair programming on it as well.

*  We both Googled to find some very helpful code snippets. We got as far as calling 2 API's and in the evening

*  Erik was able to further fiddle with the code for our Giphy call to make the gifs show up. Yay. Great progress for day one.

**Tuesday**

*  alternated between pair programming and "side-by-side" programming (when we were both Googling to figure out how to get two weather conditions to show at the same time, for example)

*  We both worked on RWD at home.

*  MB experimented at home with creating a modal to show instructions for how to use the chat bot.



**Wednesday**

*  MB located an image for our logo and coined the name Le ChatBot.  She worked on further CSS styling to refine the app's look.

*  Erik added js code snippets to improve functionality.  One example is that now a cursor is automatically awaiting user input in our text box.
