# TIY-Chatti

_Monday progress_: MB took the lead in creating the html and scss for the assignment.  Erik took the lead in starting the JavaScript file.  We did some pair programming on it as well. We both Googled to find some very helpful code snippets.  We got as far as calling 2 API's and in the evening Erik was able to further fiddle with the code for our Giphy call to make the gifs show up.  Yay.  Great progress for day one.

_Tuesday_

* alternated between pair programming and "side-by-side" programming (when we were both Googling to figure out how to get two weather conditions to show at the same time, for example)  

* We both worked on RWD at home.  

* MB experimented at home with creating a modal to show instructions for how to use the chat bot.  

* Eric worked at home on creating a logo for our app.
