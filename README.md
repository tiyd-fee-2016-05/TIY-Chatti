# TIY-Chatti

Monday progress: MB took the lead in creating the html and scss for the assignment.  Erik took the lead in starting the JavaScript file.  We did some pair programming on it as well. We both Googled to find some very helpful code snippets.  We got as far as calling 2 API's and in the evening Erik was able to further fiddle with the code for our Giphy call to make the gifs show up.  Yay.  Great progress for day one.
